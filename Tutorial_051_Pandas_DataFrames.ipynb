    "    * These labels are fixed - they will always index the same value unless you explicitly break that link.\n",
    "    * The list of labels that forms the index can either be declared upon series creation or, by default, it will range from 0 to len(data)-1.\n",
    "        * If you're going to use Pandas to organize your data, specifying usable and informative labels is a good idea because that's one of the main advantages of organizing your data in this manner - if you just want to fly blind then NumPy is usually fine on its own\n",
